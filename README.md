# Google Hashcode 2016

Our approach to the Google Hashcode 2016 online qualification round.
Read some thoughts about it [here](http://reitzig.github.io/ramblings/2016/google-hashcode-2016-our-approach),
and some general commentary on the event [here](http://reitzig.github.io/ramblings/2016/google-hashcode-2016-impressions).

Our code is GPLv3, the `.in` files are Google's.
